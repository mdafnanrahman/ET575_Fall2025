// 1. Does the AI code use C++ concepts you're unfamiliar with? Explain.
//no it dosent, i used chatgpt and the code was simple, i lernet the code in class.

// 2. Are there any issues or improvements you noticed? Explain.
// there was not issue but the i chnaged some of the text to make it look like how it was in the Example Output

// 3. What test cases did you try, and why? Explain.
//i tested both faharenheit and celsius to see of both works and it did also i tetsted the one on example output and i got the same answer
